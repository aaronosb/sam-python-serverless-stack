# sam-python-serverless-stack
Modified version of the code and guide found here: (https://serverless-stack.com/ and https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-api). Modified to use AWS SAM as the serverless framework, python as the language for the backend, and the AWS ToolKit for PyCharm.
